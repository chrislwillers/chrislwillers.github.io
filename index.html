    <h1>Chris Willers' Blog</h1>

    <p>Hey everyone.  This is my first attempt at posting a blog for Skill Distillery.  This is also my first real attempt using CSS, so we'll see how it goes.  Please bear with me.</p>
    <p>I decided to write about my previous coding experience.  I guess I technically started coding around 1987 (I'm an old guy now) when my mom and I used our Commodore 64 to
      write a very simple number guessing game program.  I didn't really know I was programming at the time, as the stuff to type in was just in a manual that came with the computer.
      Turns out, we were writing in BASIC.  It was very simple logic looking back at it, but it was a good first step.</p>
    <p>I didn't really do too much more with traditional programming languages for a while, but even in late elementary school, I started using Excel to make some pretty complicated
      spreadsheets just because I wanted to.  I learned the fun world of VLOOKUP, INDIRECT, and a whole bunch more of my favorite formulae that could help me do all the weird nerdy
      stuff that I was into.  Having some pretty advanced Excel knowledge has helped massively in my career as I've been able to automate a ton of tasks in my career's day to day.</p>
    <p>My first real dive into real coding was in college where one of my roommates was a computer science major.  He would be writing programs, and even though I didn't know the
      language (C#), I was able to help him debug his code just by kind of following along with the logic and talking it out loud.  I was a linguistics major in college, so I didn't
      need the C#, but I ended up taking a computational linguistics class where I wrote a Spanish verb conjugation program in Perl for my final project.</p>
    <p>I hadn't done much since college with it until this March when the world did it's best to end and I got laid off from my job.  I didn't want to sit around idle, so I took
      a free version of Harvard's CS50 class which used C, Python, SQLite, and various frameworks.  I found myself finishing the projects really quickly and really enjoyed it. I
      supplemented that class with some Udemy classes on Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Screen Scraping, etc., not necessarily because I was thinking about making tech my
      career, but more because I just like to know a little bit about a lot of things.</p>
    <p>I ended up being brought back by my previous employer, so went, again, without utilizing any of the skills I had picked up until I just recently got furloughed for the second time.
      Not that I'm too much of a fatalist, but I figured that was someone's way of telling me that I needed to maybe switch gears in my career.  So, here I am and I'm excited to
      learn and enter a new industry that I've been toying with for a long time.</p>
    <p class="blue">Thanks for reading everyone, and I'm excited to get to know you all.</p>
